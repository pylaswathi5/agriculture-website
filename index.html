                <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
                <p>The practice of cultivating the soil, producing crops, and keeping livestock is referred to as farming. Agriculture is critical to a country’s economic development.Nearly 58% of a country’s primary source of livelihood is farming.Most of the population in the rural areas is dependent on agriculture as their main source of income.Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, providing food, raw materials, and employment. </p>     
                <p>The main objective of agriculture is to produce food for the people, though several things affect the agricultural sectors. The cultivation of plant and food grains began years ago in order to provide food to the city population. Agriculture is the main need for the people to live in the society. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood, it provides a source for the people to earn. The major agricultural products can be widely grouped into categories of food grains, fibers and raw materials.</p>

                    <dd> Deep ploughing is a farming technique where the soil is turned over to a deeper level than usual (more than 20-30 cm). This helps control weeds by burying their seeds and disrupting their growth.</dl>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Providing best technologies and machineries to the farmers may leads to quality and quantity crop production in farming.</li><br>
                        <li>If the government could be able to provide subsidies and pesticides etc for farming activities will be a great support for farmers to cultivate better.</li><br>
                        <li>Conducting awareness programs for farmers and Agricultural labours about best agricultural practices and useful and trending technologies would be a great help.</li><br>
                        <li>Agricultural labours and farmers deaths can be decreased only by providing minimum crop production cost or by fixing basic crop value accordingly will retain their investments, which will be very helpful for them also hopeful to cultivate further.</li><br>
                    </ol>    
                        <p>The thing which our team has notices that Agriculture is becoming the last option for everyone is just because of lack of awareness, facilities and Disrespect towards the profession...But, we have to remember that " we are being alive because of the food, which is being provided by the farmers...Otherwise we are nothing...So, please respect <b>Farmers</b> and <b>Farming</b>."</p>
